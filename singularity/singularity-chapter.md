# Singularity: A Container System for MPI-based HPC Applications

In Chapter 6 we described the basic idea behind containerized applications and discussed Docker in some detail.   Docker allows us to build an application container that will run without change on any machine that can run the docker engine.  This is a fantastic way to share ready-to-run applications such as the tutorial container we built for this book, the Jupyter notebook server and many others.   In chapter 7 we discussed the various ways to scale applications in the cloud to exploit more parallelism.  We discussed how docker containers can be used as microservices that run on AWS, Azure and Google in their cloud-scale container management systems based on platforms like Kubernetes and Mesos.  In Chapter 7.2 we also described how you can build an HPC style cluster in the cloud to run MPI programs, however we did not discuss ways to run docker-based MPI programs on a distributed cluster.  It can be done, but it is not very efficient and many of the advanced networking features of a supercomputer are not usable from inside a Docker container.    

This proved to be a big problem for the people that run and manage HPC systems, because their users were demanding ways to bring the great ideas from containerization into their HPC environments.  There are actually many reasons that the managers of HPC systems would like to have some sort of containerization mechanism available to their users.  A big challenge for them is providing a computational environment that can address the needs of a wide variety of scientific communities where each community has a favorite flavor or Linux and OS-specific libraries and applications compiled with various compilers.   HPC centers typically stick to one Linux flavor and standard libraries because to do more would be impossible to manage in a mulit-user environment.   Unfortunately, these system managers did not trust Docker security for reasons we will describe below.  What was needed by the HPC system managers was a secure way to  allow containerization that would also allow access to the advanced networking and other hardware on their systems.   Jacobsen and Cannon from NERSC addressed this with Shifter in https://www.nersc.gov/assets/Uploads/cug2015udi.pdf. Another version of HPC center containerization was developed at Los Alamos National Labs by
Priedhorsky and Randles and is called CharlieCloud (see http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-16-22370 for an excellent discussion). 
Gregory M. Kurtzer from Lawrence Berkeley Lab developed Singularity (http://singularity.lbl.gov/) which may be the most widely used of these HPC container systems and we will discuss it here.

## A Gentle Introduction to Singularity.

Singularity containers differ from Docker containers in several important ways.  The major differences have to do with the way the two systems handle namespaces in Linux and the user privileges.  To understand this in deep technical detail, read the CharlieCloud paper cited above.  Our discussion here is intended to give you the basic ideas. First, recall that when Docker launches an image it is run as a process on the host that has no direct access to the hosts filesystem except for those directories that are explicitly cross mounted into the container.   Furthermore the process inside the container is running with  "root" privileges in the container's OS and with the container's filesystem. If you are running the docker container on a VM or other system where you have root privilege such as you own PC, this is not a big deal.   But if you are running on a shared, bare-metal cluster such as a university or lab supercomputer this is a very serious problem.  In these environments users are not allowed elevated privileges.   Singularity solves this  by creating image that runs with the user's identity and not root.   Furthermore Singularity does not completely close off the container's filesystem.   The process, running as the user, sees the user's home directory on the host.   In addition the dev namespace the Singularity process sees is the same one that the user normally sees on the host.  This means that the TCP and other networking stacks that are available to the user are also available inside the singularity container.   With a Docker container, the network stack is private to the container but there is a bridge to the host stack where you can map a port from one to the other.  This make it possible for the docker container image to receive TCP messages, but fancy networks like Infiniband are not visible.   And it makes the execution of MPI programs that use multiple container instances as workers extremely awkward and slow.  The whole point of MPI is ultra-fast, synchronized communication.

To create a Singularity container you must first install singularity.   We chose to do this on an instance of the AZURE data science VM on an Azure machine with 16 cores.   This is a very useful VM because of all the excellent pre-installed libraries.   It is running CentOS Linux Version 7.  Installing Singularity was easy.
<pre>
$VERSION=2.3
$wget https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/download/$VERSION/singularity-$VERSION.tar.gz
$tar xvf singularity-$VERSION.tar.gz
$cd singularity-$VERSION
$./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$make
$sudo make install
</pre>
The next step is to create a Singularity container image.   You first create a basic container image with the command
<pre>
$singularity create --size 2048 mysing-container.img 
</pre>
We used specified the size to be 2Gig to be big enough to load lost of data and libraries, but the default size of around 800Meg is big enough for what we show here.  

Next we need to load an OS and our application libraries and binaries.   Because both Singularity and CharlieCloud are based on the same Linux capabilities as Docker it is possible to load the contents of a Docker container file system into Singularity and CharlieCloud containers.   In the case of Singularity you can also load items from the command line one at a time, but it is better to bootstrap the container from a Singularity definition specification file (which we will refer to below as a Singularity "spec" file).   The one we used is shown and explained below.  This file is called "Singularity"
<pre>
BootStrap: docker
From:dbgannon/ubuntuplus

%files

%labels
MAINTAINER gannon

%environment
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

%runscript
    echo "This is what happens when you run the container..."
    /usr/bin/ring-simple

%post
    echo "Hello from inside the container"
    apt-get -y update
    apt-get -y upgrade
    apt-get -y install vim
    apt-get -y install build-essential
    apt-get -y install wget
    wget https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v2.1/downloads/openmpi-2.1.0.tar.bz2
    tar -xf openmpi-2.1.0.tar.bz2
    echo "installing openmpi"
    ls
    cd openmpi-2.1.0
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    make install
    echo "done"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
    ls /mpicodes
    mpicc /mpicodes/ring-simple.c -o /usr/bin/ring-simple

</pre>
There are six important parts to this spec file.   The top part tells Singularity we are building the container from a docker image called "dbgannon/ubuntuplus".  This docker file for dbgannon/ubuntuplus is very simple.  It contains only the basic ubuntu OS and a directory containing our source codes called "mpicodes".

We are going to build the container on our VM (where we have sudo privileges) with the command
<pre>
%sudo /usr/lib/bin/singularity bootstrap  mysing-container.img Singularity
</pre> 
where "Singularity" is the spec file above.  This bootstrap operation executes the script in the "post" section of the file. The post script updates the ubuntu OS, adds standard build tools and does a complete install of OpenMPI which puts the correct MPI libraries in /usr/local/lib in the container filespace. Finally it compiles a simple mpi program called ring-simple and stores the executable in /usr/bin.   While this may seem like a strange location for our executables, it is not unreasonable.  Note that we executed this with "root" privilege using sudo, so it is possible.

When the bootstrap completes the post script it executes the "file" spec.  This is empty here, but its role is to copy files from a host source path to a path in the container.   It then runs "environment" script.   
 
We are now ready to launch and execute the container.   The MPI program ring-simple.c that we have included is shown below.  It is basically half a ring.  mpi node 0 sends -1 to node 1.  node 1 sends 0 to node 2, etc until the highest ranking node receives the message and the program exits.  It is a trivial test that the MPI communications are working.

<pre>
#include &#60mpi.h>
#include &#60stdio.h>
#include &#60stdlib.h>
#include &#60time.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // Initialize the MPI environment
  MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);
  // Find out rank, size
  int world_rank;
  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_rank);
  int world_size;
  MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);
  char hostname[1024];
  gethostname(hostname, 1024);

  // We are assuming at least 2 processes for this task
  if (world_size < 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "World size must be greater than 1 for %s\n", argv[0]);
    MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1);
  }
  //printf("world size =%d\n", world_size);
  int number;
  int i;
  if (world_rank == 0) {
    // If we are rank 0, set the number to -1 and send it to process 1
    printf("Process 0 sending -1 to process 1\n");
    number = -1;
    MPI_Send(&number, 1, MPI_INT, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   } else if (world_rank > 0 && world_rank < world_size) {
    MPI_Recv(&number, 1, MPI_INT, world_rank-1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
    printf("Process %d received number %d from process %d on node %s\n", world_rank, number, world_rank-1, hostname);
    number = number+1;
    if (world_rank < world_size-1){
        MPI_Send(&number, 1, MPI_INT, world_rank+1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
    }
  }
  MPI_Finalize();
}
</pre>
To run this MPI program we need to execute "mpirun", which was not installed on our Azure VM.  We executed the same OpenMPI install on the Azure VM as shown in the "post" script.   Once that was done we executed the container just like a regular program with
<pre>
$mpirun -np 8 mysing-container.img
</pre>
This will invoke the "runscript" from the spec file.  The output is 
<pre>
This is what happens when you run the container...

Process 2 received number 0 from process 1 on node myDSVM
Process 6 received number 4 from process 5 on node myDSVM
Process 7 received number 5 from process 6 on node myDSVM
</pre>
Once we have our container there are a number of other Singularity commands we can use with it.  One of the most useful is the "exec" command that allows you to execute commands in the container's OS. For example, we can open an interactive shell running in the container's OS with
<pre>
$singularity exec mysing-container.img bash
</pre>
Or we can compile another MPI program in the container's environment with the container's library and then move it to the container's /usr/local/bin using the singularity copy command with sudo as follows
<pre>
$singularity exec mysing-container.img mpicc foobar.c -o foobar
$sudo /usr/local/bin/singularity copy foobar /usr/local/bin/foobar
</pre>
### Portability
To demonstrate that the container can be moved without change and executed on another system, we built an Amazon AWS CloudFormation Cluster consisting of 4 worker nodes each with 4 cores and a tiny headnode.  These nodes were all running Amazon Linux AMIs (which we believe are Rhel fedora based.   We followed the procedure outlined in the book in section 7.2.3.   However, before we could get things to work, we needed to install Singularity on the head node AND on each of the worker nodes.   Several thing made this task simple. The AWS CloudFormation Cluster automatically mounts the head node user file space directly into the user file space of each worker node.  Once we have completed the Singularity install on the head node, we need only log into each worker node and execute the 
<pre>
$cd singularity-2.3
$make install
</pre>
part.   This was easy to do with 4 nodes, but if we had 100 nodes we could submit a slurm job to do this.

We were able to build the Singularity container mysing-container.img exactly as before but it would not run with mpirun.   The problem was that the AWS cluster installs the MPICH version of MPI and not openMPI.  The MPICH mpirun was not compatible with the openmpi libraries in the container.  This was easily resolved by deploying openmpi in the headnode and each worker and changing the default paths to point to openmpi.   We could do this because we completely own our virtual cluster in AWS.   Unfortunately, the average user of a supercomputer center would need to convince the management to make this change if it was needed.   We only know of a few centers that have taken this step.  

Container technology has revolutionized large scale cloud computing.  It is now possible to build an application on your desktop and run hundreds or even thousands of instance, without change, on any of the public clouds.  Supercomputing has gone through two "portability" revolutions.  The first step was the nearly uniform adoption of Unix.  While versions of Unix varied greatly, it made it easier for users to move from one system to another.  The second revolution in portability was the introduction and wide adoption of MPI.   Adopting Singularity or one of the other HPC container technologies can  usher in a third revolution in HPC application portability.  The last missing piece of technology is a way to share containers.   We address that next.  


## The Singularity Hub
One of the great things about Docker is the Docker Hub which is the place where containers can be shared.    Singularity has its own Hub, but it works a little differently  from Docker Hub.  With the Docker Hub, you build and test your container on your own machine and then upload it to the Hub. You can then pull the container image from any machine that can contact the Docker Hub. The Singularity Hub actually builds the container from the Singularity spec file for your container. This method has one advantage and one disadvantage.  On the positive side, the size of any file you upload is far smaller than a typical Singularity image.   On the negative side, Singularity Hub cannot currently build any container.  For best results use a Singularity file that builds from a Docker image such as the example described here. We expect this problem will go away soon.

To use the Singularity Hub you put your Singularity spec file in a github repo as shown below. Here we have a github repository called dbgannon/singdoc2.  It contains the Singularity spec file we created in the previous section.  

<img src="https:/SciEngCloud.github.io/git-hub-image.jpg" width="800">

We next go to https://singularity-hub.org and login with our github id.   This asks your permission to import lots of things including all your repositories.   Look for the repo with your Singularity file and select it.   Singularity Hub will grab it and start to build it.    This may take a while (We suspect it is being built on an overloaded server somewhere in the cloud or at Stanford.)   When it is finished you will see something like the image below.  

<img src="https:/SciEngCloud.github.io/singularity-hub-image.jpg" width="800">

Once the build is complete you  can download it.   We initially built and tested the container on the Azure datascience VM.   To test  the Singularity version we went to the AWS cloud formation cluster and pulled the container from Singularity hub and ran it.  The result is shown below.
<pre>

</pre>
Works perfectly. No build required on the master node for the cluster.  just pull and run.
The Singularity Hub site https://singularity-hub.org has good documentation that illustrates many other capabilities not discussed here.  

## Final Thoughts

We were interested in the performance overhead of using Singularity.   We made a simple set of measurements of a full ring program (similar to the one above but with a full loop of communication and run for 10000 cycles).  The overhead of the singularity based version versus a "native" version was less than 2%. We attribute this to possible paging issues involving the size of the Singularity image (2GBytes) versus 2KBytes of the "native" object program.   For a serious application, we expect this overhead to vanish.
